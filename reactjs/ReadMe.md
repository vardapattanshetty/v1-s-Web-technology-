# ReactJS Basics

This repository contains a collection of basic ReactJS code examples designed to help developers get started with React. These examples demonstrate fundamental React concepts, including component creation, state management, event handling, and much more. Whether you're a beginner or looking to reinforce your knowledge, these examples provide the foundation for building modern React applications.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. **Basic React Setup**
Learn how to set up a React project from scratch using `create-react-app`, a tool that automatically sets up a new React project with a working development environment.

### 2. **Functional Components**
React encourages the use of functional components, which are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML). This section demonstrates how to create simple functional components and display content in your app.

### 3. **JSX Syntax**
JSX allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. This section explains how JSX makes it easier to build components and integrate HTML structure with JavaScript logic.

### 4. **State Management**
State is a powerful concept in React that allows components to maintain and manage their data. This section explores how to manage state in functional components using the `useState` hook, one of the most commonly used React hooks.

### 5. **Event Handling**
Handling user interactions is essential for creating interactive apps. This section covers how to handle events such as button clicks and form submissions within React components.

### 6. **Conditional Rendering**
Sometimes, you might want to display different UI elements based on certain conditions. React's conditional rendering allows you to easily show or hide parts of the UI depending on the state or props.

### 7. **Props**
Props are the mechanism by which data flows between components in React. This section shows how to pass data from parent components to child components and customize them with dynamic content.

### 8. **useEffect Hook**
The `useEffect` hook is used for managing side effects in functional components, such as fetching data or setting up subscriptions. This section covers the basic usage of `useEffect` and how to use it for tasks like fetching data from an API.

### 9. **Form Handling**
Forms are an essential part of most web applications. This section demonstrates how to manage form inputs in React using controlled components, handle form submission, and display form data.
